*"Simple GUI transitions to swap menus elegantly."*

This plugin gives access to the `GuiTransition` node which allows to transition multiple GUI layouts easily.
Designed for **Godot 3.x** (4.x version available [here](https://github.com/murikistudio/simple-gui-transitions/tree/godot-4)).
See the example scene on `addons/simple-gui-transitions/example` to see this plugin in action.

[Download it on Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1613)

## Installation
- Install the plugin through the [AssetLib](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1613) **or** copy the plugin `addons` folder to your project's directory
- Enable the plugin on `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`
- Reload your current project

## Global Settings
As of version v0.1.0 onwards the default transition settings can be set on `Project > Project Settings > GUI Transitions > Config`.
Those settings will be applied on top of any default property on the node `GuiTransition`. This is useful to increase or decrease the speed of transitions on the whole project, for example. See each property description below.

## Node `GuiTransition`
The node `GuiTransition` is responsible for transitioning a specific layout.

### Properties
#### Auto Start
If the current layout will trigger its transition at startup automatically. Enabled by default.

#### Fade Layout
If enabled, will fade the *whole layout* along with the selected animation of individual controls. The fade duration is based on the `Duration` property. Enabled by default.

#### Animation Enter
The animation type of the controls when entering the screen. The available animations are:

- Fade
- Slide left, right, up and down
- Scale vertical, horizontal and both

#### Animation Leave
The animation type of the controls when leaving the screen. The available animations are:

- Fade
- Slide left, right, up and down
- Scale vertical, horizontal and both

#### Duration
The total animation duration in seconds. A negative value such as the default `-0.01` will make the transition use the default value set in `Project Settings`.

#### Delay
Delay ratio between transitions for each node contained in `Group` or `Controls`.
The default value is `0.5`.

- A negative value such as the default `-0.01` will make the transition use the default value set in `Project Settings`.
- A delay of `0.0` means no delay, that is, all controls will start and finish their animations at the same time.
- A delay of `1.0` will make each control wait for the previous one to finish its animation to start its own.
- A delay between `0.0` and `1.0` will make controls intertwine animations, giving a smoother effect.

**Note:** See `addons/simple-gui-transitions/example/layout_3.tscn` for an interactive and visual representation of different delay ratios.

#### Layout ID
Optional ID of layout to trigger changes on the singleton `GuiTransitions` (at method parameters named `id`).
If empty, will be assumed as the `Layout` node name.

#### Layout
The main layout node. It will be hidden and shown accordingly. Should be the topmost node of the current layout. **Required!**

#### Controls
Array of individual nodes to be animated.
The order will be taken in account to apply the animation `Delay`.
**If empty, a `Group` must be set.**

#### Group
A node with children controls to be animated in sequence.
The order will be taken in account to apply the animation `Delay`.
Example: a `HBoxContainer` or `VBoxContainer` with several buttons as children will allow to animate all buttons one by one.
**If not set, `Controls` must be selected.**

#### Center Pivot
When `Animation Enter` or `Animation Leave` is one of the scale animations, it will center the control's `rect_pivot_offset` property.

#### Transition Type
Transition curve of the animations. Same as `Tween.TransitionType`.

#### Ease Type
Ease curve of the animations. Same as `Tween.EaseType`.

## Singleton `GuiTransitions`
The singleton `GuiTransitions` allows to trigger the transitions globally and swap GUI layouts.

### Signals
#### show_completed
The signal `show_completed` is emited after a layout has been shown.

#### hide_completed
The signal `hide_completed` is emited after a layout has been hidden.

### Public Methods
#### go_to(id: String, function: FuncRef, args: Array)
The method `go_to` hides the current layout and shows the layout with the given `id`.
If `function` (optional) and `args` (optional) are passed in, the `function` will be executed halfway through.
Both signals `hide_completed` and `show_completed` are emited accordingly.

#### update(function: FuncRef, args: Array)
The method `update` hides and shows the current layout.
If `function` (optional) and `args` (optional) are passed in, the `function` will be executed halfway through.
Both signals `hide_completed` and `show_completed` are emited accordingly.

#### show(id: String)
The method `show` shows the layout with the given `id`.
Emits the signal `show_completed` on completion.

#### hide(id: String)
The method `hide` hides the layout with the given `id`, or all visible layouts if no `id` is passed in.
Emits the signal `hide_completed` on completion.

#### is_shown(id: String)
The method `is_shown` returns if the layout with the given `id` is currently visible.

#### is_hidden(id: String)
The method `is_hidden` returns if the layout with the given `id` is currently hidden.
